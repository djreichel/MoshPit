# MoshPit
Our first group project in Bootcamp from Crystal, Andre, Paul and D.J.

MoshPit is an application created to make concert planning easier.

Used MoshPit to locate information regarding your favorite band, such as read a short biography, look at photos and learn their tour schedule.

In the future we want to add a playlist and music videos for you listening entertainment.

We want you to be able to buy tickets through TicketMaster or an equivalent ticket sales service.

We want you to be able to make travel reservations through Kayak or an equivalent hotel and airline reservation service.

We also want to include a link to City Guide or LocalEyes so our concert-goer will have access to information regarding their destination city.
